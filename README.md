# Hash-Program
      You are to write a program to set up a data base for a phone index.
      The key will be a personâ€™s name and the table will supply the phone number.
      The data base must be implemented as a hash table with the names as the key.
      The input data file is out on blackboard.  The format will be a person name
      (multiple parts) followed by a phone number.  Example:   John Doe   601-5433
      or O E Vay  921-1234.  Only one name one phone number will be on an input line.
      Set your hash table up to be 79 entries, hash table is 79 in size.
      1.	 Print out the final data base (hash table) and indicate how many collisions
      were made in building the data base.
      2.   After building the Phone Index, show examples of looking up a name and
      returning a phone number.  Also show examples of looking up a name that are not in
      the table. You are to come up with your own hash function. You are to have very few
      collisions.  A large number of collisions will reduce your grade on this assignment.
